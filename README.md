# espcho
Experimental osu! 2010 (b1596) server, running on ESP32

## Status
This server is very experimental, it will probably never be production ready (why would you run a production server on a microcontroller anyways?)

## Code style
Please avoid C++ style code as much as possible and stick to C. When you have to use C++, don't use modern features.
