Experimental osu! server for 2010 clients, running on ESP32. It's designed for the b1596 version of the game, but additionally other versions between b695 and b1719 are working to some extent.

## Status
This server is very experimental, it will probably never be production ready (why would you run a production server on a microcontroller anyways?)

## Hiatus
I haven't been working on this project for some time due to being unable to get the SD card module to work with the ESP32. However when I fix this issue, I will return to this.
